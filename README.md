This repository contains learning materials for CP 4190/6190 Intro to Climate Change Planning at Georgia Institute of Technology, School of City and Regional Planning  

Course name: Intro to Climate Change Planning  
Instructor: Yiyi He  
Contact email: yiyi.he@design.gatech.edu

## Overview
This course is an introduction to the major topics in climate change planning, including the scientific basis of the greenhouse effect, the history of Earth’s climate, energy options, economics, and public policy, the effect of climate change on food, water, and health, and the national and international legal frameworks for the management of climate change.  

The issues around climate change are evolving rapidly, both politically and within the wider community. This course aims to provide a broad, cross-disciplinary approach to climate change. In particular, students will explore and debate the issues on a range of topics, with an emphasis on the international and global implications.  

The course will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to all aspects of the climate change debate. Students will be provided with the opportunity to explore current issues and to interact with scientific researchers with expertise and interests in climate change. In addition, students will be asked to evaluate and integrate this information within their own local context.  

## Learning objectives
1. Be able to contrast disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives on climate change to evaluate local and international public discourse on the topic.

2. Investigate contemporary issues of national and global importance related to climate change and be able to apply relevant disciplinary perspectives to answer different aspects of questions raised.

3. Demonstrate the ability to critically analyze information on climate change through written and oral communication activities.

4. Demonstrate the capacity to integrate disciplinary knowledge and approaches when discussing interdisciplinary problems.

5. Define and identify the disciplinary foundation of key terms, concepts, and theories of climate change knowledge.

6. Understand how their disciplinary expertise contributes to and responds to climate change.

On the completion of this course, students should have developed the following generic skills:  

- Quantitative skills, including the ability to compute estimates of relevant data required to understand the scientific issues;
- The ability to write a logically argued and properly researched essay; 
- The ability to critically assess information from a range of sources, and assess its quality and relevance to the questions under consideration.

## Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should provide documentation to the Access Disabled Assistance Program for Tech Students (http://www.adapts.gatech.edu/) and bring an ADAPTS accommodation letter to the instructor indicating the nature of accommodations required. This should be done within the first week of class or as soon as possible after a new disability condition arises. All efforts will be made to provide reasonable accommodations.  

## Evaluation
The course will be structured as a combined lecture-lab course. You are expected to have read all assigned readings ahead of time, and be prepared to actively participate in class discussions. Students will be evaluated on two sets of tasks: three lab projects and a final course project. The formal requirements are as follows:

_Three Lab Projects (45 pts total, 15 pts each):_
Through the completion of three lab assignments, students will gain first-hand knowledge of the use and operation of GIS and Python in climate change planning and analytics. For late submissions, a .5 point/day penalty will be applied.

_Applied Project (15 pts on Presentation, 40 pts on Project paper):_
The final class requirement is a team-based project that applies the knowledge learned in the class to a real-world problem. Fifteen percent of the total course grade will be a formal presentation to the class. Please note that all written assignments (unless otherwise noted) are to be submitted through the “Assignments” tab. Late project report/paper submissions are not accepted. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that assignments submitted through Canvas are successfully uploaded into the system.
